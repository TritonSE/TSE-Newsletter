# TSE-Newsletter

Please do not directly edit version0.html, this is the file you should reference! The newsletter.html file is the one we will use.

Feel free to test with your own files in your branches!

We will write a script to generate the HTML files using the (Dominate library)[https://github.com/Knio/dominate].

To install, run: `sudo pip install dominate`
